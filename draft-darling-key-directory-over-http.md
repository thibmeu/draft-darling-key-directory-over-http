HTTP.

# Introduction

Multiple Internet protocols rely on public key cryptography. They require keys
to be distributed by Origins to Clients. This can be done via certificates,
software releases, or HTTP. This document focuses on this last mechanism. It
aims to set recommendations on how to design a key directory that is served
over HTTP.

Distribution via HTTP allows for a more dynamic use of public keys, for
rotation, or caching on intermediate mirrors or clients.
This document specifies which cache directives origin should set, how clients
and mirrors should consume cache directive set by origins, how origins should
expose their key directory, and rotate them. This complements reccomendations
provided by {{HTTP-BEST-PRACTICES}}, narrowing them for key directories
protocols.

The document does not cover a specific directory format, as these needs vary
from one protocol to the next.

# Motivation

{{Section 5 of JOSE}} and
{{Section 7 of COSE}} both define ways to structure key sets, but no way to serve them.
This creates issues when serving these keys over HTTP because caching is not
taken into account, and there is no standard way to derive an ID from a key.
{{Section 4 of PRIVACYPASS}}, {{Section 3 of OHTTP}}, and
{{Section 4.7.1 of DAP}} are also defining their own public key
directory, and are faced with similar issues. While Privacy Pass seems to have
been the most thorough, even considering {{CONSISTENCY}} for instance, these seem to
be duplicated efforts that would benefit from being consolidated into one
specification.

# Presentation Language

This document uses the TLS presentation language {{!RFC8446}} to describe the
structure of protocol messages.  In addition to the base syntax, it uses two
additional features: the ability for fields to be optional and the ability for
vectors to have variable-size length headers.

## Variable-Size Vector Length Headers

In the TLS presentation language, vectors are encoded as a sequence of encoded
elements prefixed with a length.  The length field has a fixed size set by
specifying the minimum and maximum lengths of the encoded sequence of elements.

In this document, there are several vectors whose sizes vary over significant
ranges.  So instead of using a fixed-size length field, it uses a variable-size
length using a variable-length integer encoding based on the one described in
{{Section 16 of ?RFC9000}}. They differ only in that the one here requires a
minimum-size encoding. Instead of presenting min and max values, the vector
description simply includes a `V`. For example:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    uint32 fixed<0..255>;
    opaque variable<V>;
} StructWithVectors;
~~~

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The following terms are used throughout this document:

**Client:**
: An entity using public key material.

**Origin:**
: An entity exposing public key material via HTTP.

**Mirror:**
: An intermediary entity between client and origin. May cache data, and act as a
  privacy proxy.

**Key metadata:**
: Public data associated to a public key.

**Key Directory:**
: Set of public keys.

**Directory Metadata:**
: Public data associated to a key directory. This is protocol specific.


# Architecture

An Origin is exposing a key directory for Clients to fetch. Clients may fetch the
directory from a Mirror, either to protect its privacy, or because the Origin
wants to leverage a content delivery network. The endpoint and request pattern
should be the same as if the fetch was to an Origin.

This document focuses on the below interaction, which is triggered when the
Client does not have valid key for the Origin. This can be because the Client is
new, its cache is expired, or the Origin refuses requests with the current key set.

## Key ID {#key-id}

Each key in the directory is associated with a unique Key ID.

Key ID has to be derived from key material that is shared publicly.
Protocols SHOULD provide the following blob of data:

~~~tls
struct {
  opaque ProtocolBlob<V>;
} PublicKeyMaterial;
~~~

PublicKeyMaterial may be composed of both cryptographic material and metadata.

Key ID is defined has follow:

~~~
key_id = encode(H(PublicKeyMaterial))
~~~

where

* `PublicKeyMaterial` is a length-prefix-encoded blob of data
* `H` is a hash function
* `encode` is some encoding function

**TODO Open questions about H**

* Should the draft provide specific H?
* Should the draft define an IANA registry and require protocols to register
  their H?

## Key Selection

The following is a deterministic algorithm for determining which Key a Client
uses to fulfill their cryptographic needs. By using a deterministic
algorithm, Origins can more easily predict the effects of a Key rotation and
implement grace periods, soak times, etc. Protocols may place additional
restrictions, or push these decision details to deployments.

### Algorithm

1. **Filter invalid keys**: Exclude keys that:
   * Have a `not-after` field in the past.
   * Have a {{not-before}} field in the future.
   * Do not meet required cryptographic properties.
2. **Set missing activation times**: If a key does not have a {{not-before}} field, set it to either:
   * The `Last-Modified` header from the request as defined in {{Section 8.8.2 of HTTP}}, if available.
   * The Date header from the request as defined in {{Section 6.6.1 of HTTP}}, if available.
   * The clientâ€™s local time.
3. **Sort by activation time**: If a {{not-before}} field exists, sort the
   remaining keys in **descending** order based on {{not-before}}.
4. **Select the first key**: Choose the first key from the Key Directory, as
   ordered in the Key Directory format.

Clients should implement the Key Selection Algorithm. Origins should present
the newest Keys first.

For protocols which define a {{not-before}} field, the above algorithm minimizes the
chance that the Client uses a key that has expired between fetching the directory
from the origin and its usage as part of the protocol.

For protocols without a {{not-before}} field, using the first key allows Origin
to present their key directory so that the newest is always first, and
the soon-to-be-removed key is last. This minimizes the chance of a client using
an expired key.

Expired key may be presented for completion, only if the protocol defines a
`not-after` field.

## Rotation {#rotation}

Key directories are not permanent: they change over time. Origins SHOULD
rotate keys on a schedule. Clients are going to fetch keys upon an immediate
rotation for security reasons. This section goes over how an Origin rotates
its keys, and how that interacts with scheduled and immediate rotations.

### Algorithm

We approach a public key generation by the following function

~~~
Generate(params, RAND) -> (publickey, privatekey, metadata)
~~~

At any point in time, all keys in the directory have a unique key id as defined in {{key-id}}.
When adding a key in the directory, that key has a unique key id.

Generation looks as follows

~~~
do
  (publickey, privatekey, metadata) <- Generate(params, RAND)
  public_key_material <- (publickey | metadata)
  key_id <- encode(H(public_key_material))
while (key_id is not unique)
~~~

### Scheduled rotation

Scheduled rotation happens at a time known to Origins, Clients, and Mirrors.
This may be a regular interval (monthly, weekly, daily), or an ad-hoc schedule
agreed between all parties.

Scheduled rotations are communicated in one of the two mode below

**Passive:**
: Origins rely on cache headers to inform Clients about key expiry. They stop
  advertising the key at time `t`, and delete it at time `t_expiry=t+maxage`.
  Origins may have to take intermediate mirrors into considerations, if they
  are aware these mirrors don't respect their cache headers.

**Active:**
: Origins keep serving the key and add a `not-after` field. This field should be
  at least `t+maxage`.

With both modes, an Origin has to signal a key is not supported by sending a
response with status code 400. For instance, the error can include a key ID as
defined in {{key-id}}.

### Immediate {#immediate}

Origins might have to rotate keys immediately. Existing keys may have to be
invalidated and/or new keys be provisioned. Immediate key rotation can happen in
the event of a key compromise, loss, or other imperious reason.

Immediate key rotation will cause some client requests to the server to fail
until the client and mirrors retrieve a new version of the directory. The key
directory endpoint is going to be placed under a higher load.

1. Origins should consider introducing a random backoff to spread the load of
   key distribution over time. See {{cache-behaviour}}
2. Clients on a scheduled rotation should be configured to distrust rotation outside
   a fixed window. Such policies should be defined by protocols.

## Cache behaviour {#cache-behaviour}

Caching the Key Directory lowers latency and reduces resource usage on
Mirrors and the Origin. An optimal caching strategy should minimize resource
usage for both the Client and Origin while preventing the client from using an
invalid key.

These two requirements, minimizing resource usage and never using an invalid
key, are at odds with each other. In the event of an {{immediate}} key rotation, a
Client might use an invalid key. However, if a Client fetches an Origin key
directory for every request, it would waste time and network resources.

This section provides interaction with some cache directive. Deployments should
also consider the recommendations laid out in {{Section 4.9 of HTTP-BEST-PRACTICES}}.

### `not-before` fields {#not-before}

Protocols should define a `not-before` field. This field can be attached by Origins
to each Key in the Directory. The `not-before` field allows
Origins to signal to Clients when a Key is ready to use and reduces the
chance a Client uses a key which is not yet available. not-before fields SHOULD
be a Unix epoch timestamp in seconds.

### Cache directives

Origins responds with cache directives {{HTTP-CACHE}}. These
control when the Key Directory should be refreshed. For instance, Origins
provides a
`Cache-Control: max-age` header, or `Expires` header which is slightly less than
the grace period given for a key about to rotate. Clients should respect the
`max-age` cache directive or other directives. If an Origin
provides a `max-age` header and a Mirror is used, an Origin should provide a
`s-maxage` header that is equivalent to `max-age`.

To prevent Clients refreshing their Key Directories at the same time
(synchronization), Mirrors should provide to its clients a `max-age` cache
directive with duration in the range `[0, Origin s-maxage]`.

Origins should consider using `Date` ({{Section 6.6.1 of HTTP}}) and
`Last-modified` ({{Section 8.8.2 of HTTP}}) headers to ease {{rotation}}.

### Client cache refresh

The primary method a Client should use to determine when it refreshes its view
of the Key Directory is through the delta seconds described in the `max-age`
cache directive. The higher the delta, the less frequent a Client will update
its cache. The lower the delta, the quicker clients will respond to unplanned
key rotations.

`min-fresh` could also be sent by Origins as defined in {{HTTP-CACHE}}.

## Well known URL

It is recommended protocols register a {{!WELL-KNOWN=RFC8615}} URL and associated
content-type.

A key directory server should consider supporting both GET and HEAD request on
that endpoint.

~~~
GET /.well-known/<your-protocol>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=<Client Cache TTL>, s-maxage=<Shared Cache TTL>
Content-Type: <your-protocol>
Last-Modified: <datestamp>
~~~

HEAD requests can be used by Clients to cheaply determine if the directory has
changed. The Origin server SHOULD issue a `Last-Modified` header with the date
stamp of when the key directory resource was last modified.

If issuing a `Last-Modified` header, the Origin server SHOULD support the correct
response to a `If-Modified-Since` HTTP GET or HEAD request, returning the
appropriate HTTP status codes {{HTTP-CACHE}}.

It is recommended that Mirrors support `Last-Modified` and `If-Modified-Since`
{{HTTP-CACHE}}.

## Future considerations

These considerations should be addressed in future drafts. Defining them now
appears to be premature as the core of the draft does not have consensus.

### Consistency

Consistency allows client to prevent themselves from split view attack. A
proposal that has been made for Privacy Pass is to use multiple mirrors
{{CONSISTENCY}}. With a sufficiently high quorum, clients get more confident
that they are not singled out.
It presents scalability issues as you need multiple mirrors, and have one more
requests from client per mirror in the quorum.

### Key Transparency

Key Directory over HTTP SHOULD integrate with transparency, once the protocol has
been defined in {{KEYTRANS}}.
There are specific consideration as to what goes in the log: the full
directory, keys individually, privacy considerations.



# Privacy Considerations

Clients fetching keys mean they reveal their IP, time, and other informations.
When the key directory is provided by an Origin distinct from the Origin
providing service, Clients SHOULD consider proxying their traffic through a
Mirror server provided by the service they use. This may happen if the Origin
service delegates key management to a third party for instance.
Mirrors SHOULD NOT collide with the key server in an attempt to break Client
privacy.

# Test vectors

Implementation may test the following scenarios
1. One key is provided on a normal basis, the key rotates:
  1. does the directory has two entries or one?
  2. what are the cache headers?
  3. what are the keys as seen by a client?
  4. does the new key has a unique key id?

2. Key has to be rotated immediately
  1. How long does it take for client to notice
  2. What is the backoff to avoid a thundering herd issue

# Non normative proposals

## For JOSE

JOSE has a key directory in the form of JWK Set as defined in {{Section 5 of JOSE}}.
However, it does not addhere to the best practices laid down here, despite being
Web keys. This would be valuable as the group aims to integrates with all sort
of cryptographic keys, as can be seen with the new HPKE proposal {{JOSE-HPKE}}.

Following these recommendations, JOSE may define:

* A well-known URI
* A deterministic Key ID
* Recommendations for caching and rotation, or leave it to implementations.

## For COSE

Same as the above, for COSE Key Set.

# Use cases

See existing key directory on https://key-directory-over-http.research.cloudflare.com/

## DAP

Defined in {{Section 4.5.1 of DAP}}.

~~~tls
HpkeConfig HpkeConfigList<0..2^16-1>;

uint16 HpkeAeadId; /* Defined in [HPKE] */
uint16 HpkeKemId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
uint16 HpkeKdfId;  /* Defined in [HPKE] */
~~~

Partially informed comments:

* HpkeConfigId could be removed
* Need not-before to handle early capture

  HPKE KEM ID (16),
  HPKE Public Key (Npk * 8),
  HPKE Symmetric Algorithms Length (16) = 4..65532,
  HPKE Symmetric Algorithms (32) ...,
}
~~~

Partially informed comments:

* Key Identifier could be removed/be deterministic
* No mention of not-before
* No mention of HTTP Caching for rotation

## Privacy Pass

Defined in {{Section 4 of PRIVACYPASS}}

    ]
 }
~~~

Partially informed comments:
* Not as flexible as HPKE
* Has some protocol metadata (token-type, issuer-request-uri, rate-limit)
